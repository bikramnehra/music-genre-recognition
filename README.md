# music-genre-recognition

This project presents an approach for the music genre classification
problem. The proposed approach uses temporal feature vector and weighted
voting to improve the prediction accuracy. Classical machine learning
algorithms such as Na√Øve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector
Machines are employed and weighted voting procedures were employed in
order to enhance final prediction results. Experiments were carried out on a
dataset obtained from Music Analysis, Retrieval and Synthesis for Audio
Signals (MARSYAS) which is an open source software framework and data
collection of audio files. The dataset contains 1,000 audio files categorized
in 10 musical genres. Experimental results show that the proposed ensemble
approach produces better results than the ones obtained from individual
classifiers.
